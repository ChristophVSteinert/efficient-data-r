# Efficient Data Managent with R

### Abstract
The software environment R is widely used for data analysis and data visualization in the social sciences and beyond. Additionally, it is becoming increasingly popular as a tool for data and file management. Focusing on these latter aspects, this workshop by [Denis Cohen](https://twitter.com/denis_cohen), [Cosima Meyer](https://twitter.com/cosima_meyer), [Marcel Neunhoeffer](https://twitter.com/mneunho), [Oliver Rittmann](https://gess.uni-mannheim.de/doctoral-programs/social-and-behavioral-sciences-cdss/students/people/show/oliver-rittmann.html) illustrates the workflow and best practices for efficient data management in R.

Participants will learn about:

- the workflow for organizing and conducting complex analyses in R
- creating, editing, and accessing directory hierarchies and their contents
- data merging, data management and data manipulation using tidy R and base R
- the basics of programming and debugging

A corresponding tutorial on our blog [Methods Bites](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/) is available [here](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/article/efficient-data-r/).
